# CS300AnalysisAndDesign

**Q** - What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

  **A** - The projects in this course both had the goal of designing a system to load, manage, and search through school data from the clients. The first project focused on testing the viability of different data structures. Using pseudocode and a big-O analysis, project one provided me with insight into which data structure I should use in the actual implementation put into practice in project 2. 
  
**Q** - How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

  **A** - With the knowledge gained in Project 1, I utilized a binary search tree to load, sort, and manage school data provided by the client. During Project 2, I also created functions to load in and validate data from a file and a method to print all information loaded into the system.
  
**Q** - How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

**A** - One roadblock that comes to mind is the fact that I've never worked with a binary search tree prior to this class. While I had never specifically worked with them before, I was able to quickly understand how to utilize and manipulate the trees. This was thanks to our courses in ZyBooks and some external research I did. Any other obstacles were generally overcome through research external to the course's materials.

**Q** - How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

**A** - The work on this project has given me more experience with data structures I was not immediately familiar with, which allows me to take them into consideration for future projects. Project 1's pseudocode development and analysis also provided me with more experience in designing and planning a program prior to implementation.
  
**Q** - How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

**A** - Prior to this class, I had a decent amount of experience when it came to writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code by using best practices. These practices were only reinforced thanks to the overall quality of the course and the work I was able to do on the projects. Whether it was by keeping functions highly modular or by using clear and concise notes where needed, my goal was to implement best practices when developing the pseudocode in Project 1 or the program in Project 2.Â
